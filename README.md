# 🧠 NeuraChat – Scalable LLM-Powered Conversational AI

> **Empowering intelligent conversations with fine-tuned LLMs and scalable microservices.**

---

## 📚 Project Overview
**NeuraChat** is an AI-powered conversational system built using advanced **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like Ollama, TinyLLaMA, Mistral, DistilGPT-2, and Phi-2.  
The chatbot architecture is designed to be scalable and modular, using Flask microservices, PostgreSQL for structured data, and deployed on Virtual Machines (VMs) to simulate real-world environments.  
Fine-tuning techniques like **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** were applied to optimize model performance and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- Fine-tuned LLMs using **LoRA** to optimize accuracy and efficiency.
- Microservice-based backend built with **Flask** for modular and scalable interaction handling.
- **PostgreSQL** integration for dynamic knowledge base and structured data storage.
- Deployment-ready infrastructure using **Virtual Machines** for scalable real-world simulation.
- Secured API endpoints for user communication and authentication.
- Enhanced natural language understanding using **NLP** techniques.
- Dynamic data ingestion pipelines through **web scraping** tools.
